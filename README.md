## What ScoutBot Does

- 🔍 **Scrapes 30+ sources** every 6 hours — aggregators, Nigerian portals, Asia-specific scholarship pages, and Reddit RSS feeds
- 📊 **Writes to two separate tabs**: Nigeria 🇳🇬 and International 🌍 — never mixed
- 🧹 **Auto-cleans the sheet daily** — expired entries removed, nothing stays on the list longer than 3 weeks
- 📧 **Sends one weekly email** every Sunday with only opportunities added in the last 7 days
- 🔗 **Links go directly to application pages** — not blog posts
- 🚫 **Students only** — scholarships, fellowships, internships, bootcamps. No startup/VC/accelerator content

## 💛 Support ScoutBot

ScoutBot is open source and free for every user. We are Nigerian students building this with zero budget.

**Fundraising goal:** ₦2,000,000 (~$1,500 USD) for Twitter/X advertising to reach 4,000 Nigerian students.

## Why ScoutBot Exists

Opportunities for Nigerian students are scattered across dozens of websites with no single reliable source. ScoutBot runs quietly in the background, finds new opportunities as they appear, logs them into a shared spreadsheet, and delivers them straight to people's inboxes — once a week, clean and fresh.

**This is a bot, not a web app.** No dashboard, no login page, no frontend — just an automated Python system that works.

---

## How It Works

```
Every 6 hours:
  1. scrapy crawl opportunities  →  finds new items, writes to Nigeria / International tab
  2. python run.py --cleanup     →  removes entries older than 21 days or with past deadlines

Every Sunday 10AM WAT:
  3. python run.py --notify      →  sends weekly digest (last 7 days only) to all subscribers

Every 1st of month:
  4. python welcome.py           →  sends welcome email to all subscribers
```
